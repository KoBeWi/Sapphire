The examples show pretty all functionality you'll find in Sapphire 'framework'.
Each has an Explanation file that tells you what is in the example and how to use it in your game. There's also a summary of features and list of source files to look in. Files are located in 'data/scripts'
Note that examples are not based on the final state of Sapphire you would see in your game, but obsolete parts of code don't interrupt it in any way. Also, the code is well commented. But some of functions have skipped explanations, since they are the main subject of another example.
And remember that everything is based on 'framework' so don't get surprised if you see methods like Img or Keypress, which doesn't exist in Gosu.

Also, README referenced in example help files isn't this file, but the Sapphire's main one. Just in case you didn't know.
