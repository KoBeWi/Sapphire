This example is nothing more than a remake of Gosu's Cptn Ruby into Cptn Sapphire basing on my 'framework'.
I left most of old code, changing some things so it uses my system. Most noticable change is that the map is made of image not a text file. Also, the camera moves in a nice smooth manner.
This example is also a base for some other examples.

Well, to sum up how to add your own entity. Just make some class and it mus have Entity inheritance (class Your_Class < Entity)
Somewhere in initialize you should call init method (or even externally).
After calling init, entity is automatically updated and drawn unless don't have such methods or have @stop or @invisible variables set true.

Summary - This example shows how to:
-make some map
-add entities
-make a player
-set some boundary to camera and make it follow an entity
-use some resources
