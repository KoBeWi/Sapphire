This example is about some near-useless utility objects.
First one is delayer. It's used to delay object's update method by switching @stop variable. Im creates lagging effect instead of desired slow-motion, but still someone can use it as it works for ANY Entity. Hold Space to lag everything, but camera.
Second is flasher. It creates simple flashing effect by disabling draw for entity. Use Left Control to flash Cptn Sapphire.
Third is mover. It just moves ANY Entity with choosen speed. In this example, it slowly moves gems down.
Each one of these takes first argument as array of target entities and then time for Delayer, two times for Flasher and x speed and y speed for mover.

There's also a timer class. It's created passing number of ticks to count. When it finishes, it just changes it's @finished variable to true and removes.
But very interesting feature is the Timer.image, which returns remaining frames (ticks) as a string with time representation (minutes, seconds etc.) and you can choose which ones to show.
In the example, if Timer finishes it's job, all gems disappear.

Summary - This example shows how to:
-use Delayer, Flasher and Mover
-use timer
-show timer
