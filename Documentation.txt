Specjal commands:
!scite - opens text editor
!template - creates template for game
  You can specify title by typing it after space

Template is an empty game project with useful classes to help developing.

Classe index (note that there are only some explanations, open files to see constructors etc. Some of them share similar methods so they are not descibed)
1.Main
Window class responsible for updating and drawing game states and reading input.

 def button_down/up(id)
 Checks if specified key is pressed/released. Needs to be placed in state class to work

2.Keypress
Used for input checking, may use buttons from $keys

  def Keypress.[](id,repeat)
  id - Gosu::Button or symbol (located in $keys)
  repeat - when false, key is triggered once until releasing it

3.Img \ Snd
Loads specified resoure and saves in memory for re-use

  def .[](name,/tileable/,/pre/)
  name - path to resource
  tileable - used only for Img, true if image has to be tileable
  pre - apply prelude to music. It will be played at the beginning and then the actual music is looped. Prelude must be separate file named '(music_name)-pre'. Using :auto will seek automatically if there's prelude available
  Images need to be .png , music and sound .ogg

4.Tls
Loads tiles from image

  def Tls.[](name,width,height,tileable)
  width/height - size per tile, lower than 0 splits image into width/height tiles

5.Fnt
Loads fonts

  def Fnt.[](name,size)
  name - path to font or name of .ttf file from system's fonts. if specified as Tls array, makes a BitmapFont (see below)
  size - height of the font or array with order of characters for BitmapFont (see below)

6.BitmapFont
Specjal class for custom fonts

  def initialize(name,characters)
  name - array of images (use Tls method here)
  characters - array of characters as they are ordered in font's image. There's no difference in upcase or downcase chars

  def draw(x,y,z,args)
  args - hash arguments:
    :scalex/scaley - scale of characters
    :xspacing/yspacing - space between letters, defaultly is letter's size
    :max - maximal width of text in one line
    :align - :right or :center, no support for multiline text (yet?)
    :color - works best for greyscale images. Gosu::Color or hex 0xaarrggbb

6.Entity
Main class for game objects.

  @stop (accessor) - prevents entity update
  @invisible (accessor) - skips entity in drawing
  @removed (reader) - entity was removed (see below)

  def init(types)
  Pushes entity to game's entity array, so it's being updated. Use types arrray for grouping entities for easier managing

  def remove
  Deletes entity from game's entity array and all group arrays. Note that entity will vanish at the end of update cycle. Calling this sets @removed variatble to true on first

  def gravity(width,height,gravity)
  Method for simple falling physics
  width/height - size of object. When no height is give, it will take width value

7.Game
Default class for handling game action. Manages in-game objects.

  def solid?
  Method to check if current coordinates are solid. Needs to be manually defined

  def reset
  Deletes all in-game entities
  
  def missing?(entity)
  Checks if entity is removed
  
  def find(block)
  Searchs entitiy passing specified block
  
  def find2(group,block)
  Searchs entitiy in given grouo passing specified block

8.Counter
Object used for countdowns

  @finished (reader) - true if time reaches 0
  @time - current time

  def image(h,m,s,hs)
  Returns string which converts time into hours, minutes, seconds and hundreth of seconds (use variables to specify display)

9.Mover
Basic object to move group of entities together

10.Flasher
Toggles entities' @invisible variable to make them flash effect

  def initialize(entities,time1,time2)
  time1/time2 - how often variable is toggling

11.Delayer
Slows entities' update for certain ammount of frames (see: Flasher)

12.Particle
Simple falling object, may be use eg. for crashing glass

  def initialize(x,y,z,img,vx,vy,args)
  img - path to image or array for tile values (["imagename",w,h] instead of Tls method)
  vx/vy - initial speed
  args - hash arguments:
    :angle - initial angle of image (default: 0)
    :rotate - speed of image's rotating
    :scalex/:scaley - objects scale
    :color - color filter for image

13.Trail
Single animation sequence, which disappears after finishing

  def initialize(x,y,z,tiles,sequence,time,args)
  tiles - not Tls, but simple array (see: Particle)
  sequence - array of numbers, corresponding for frames in animation
  time - frame length of each frame
  args - :scalex, :scaley, :color

14.Trace
Single image, which fades out particular time

  def initialize(x,y,img,speed,args={})
  speed - speed of fading (max 255)
  args - :angle,:scalex,:scaley,:color (MUST be Gosu::Color)


How to use GUI
-First you need to enable it, by calling  $enable_gui=true
-Then just initialize some GUI objects to use them. It's better to place them in GUI's window. To initialize objects use GUI::(ObjName).new
-GUI graphics can be customized in data/GUI. Use only four colors from GUI palette for compatibility

>Window
-GUI::Window.new(x,y,width,height,title,customization)
x,y - position of window
width,height - window size
title - window caption
customization - array for options
  example:
  [[:separator,[10,10,50,50]] , [:object,[:button_1,Button.new(20,20,"Press me"]] , [:nox]]
  
  Above you can see 3 types of customization. Each customization is double array: name in symbol and then an array for options.
  -Layout
  You can add texts and separators to your window.
      :separator - [x1, y1, x2, y2]
      :text - [text, x, y]
      
  -Objects
  Add GUI elements. The first option for objects is its name referenced by window, second is new objects insance. They are listed below. Note that objects position is relative to window's
  
  -Additional options
  Window settings, they take no arguments
  :nox - window will have no X for closing
  :disabled - window is invisible at start
  :dock - window is unmovable
  
Windows can be closed and moved. You can only use actve window (the one with foreground border) and to activate window, just click its header, what will automatically move it to top
Windows has also instance variables that can be changed anytime: @nox, @docked, @disabled
You can also retrieve and set values of window's objects by Window.value(object name) and Window.set_value(objects name, value)

>GUI Objects
Every objects has its  :value  accessor so values can be easily read and written
They have a   :changed   reader, that returns true if value was changed last frame
They also have a variable  @disabled  that makes them invisible

Button - a bassic button. Read value to check if it's pressed
Arguments: (x, y, text)

Zip - a zip bar with numeric value
Arguments: (x, y, max value, unit)
-unit - pixel distance between values

Check - a simple checkbox
Arguments: (x, y, negateable)
-negateable - check normally takes true or nil, but negateable enables additionally false

Radio - radio-type choice
Arguments: (x, y, choices)
-choices - it's an array of available selections ; it can be modified dynamically

Dropdown - dropdown-box-type choice
Arguments: (x, y, choices)
-choices - it can be modified dynamically

Textbox - a monospaced line of text input
Arguments: (x, y, max)
-max - maximal number of characters

Number - numeric input
Arguments: (x, y, minimal value, maximal value)
min and max can be modified dynamically

Radio and Dropdown have a   value2   method that returns currently selected text rather than choice id
